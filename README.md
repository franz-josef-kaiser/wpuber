# WPUber

A wecodemore project.

## Setup

_In the future I hope that I can add a different branch that runs parallel to `master`, which
is a final package: minified, concatenated files, etc._

Install the needed Dependency Managers. If you already got them installed, you can skip that part

1. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) - Dependency Manager for PHP - even has a Windows .exe-installer
1. [npm](http://nodejs.org) - the Node.js Package Manager - Used for JavaScript dependencies
1. Bower - a Node.js based JavaScript Package Manager - can be installed globally by using `npm install -g bower`

After you've done that, you can run

1. `composer install`
1. `npm install`
1. `bower install`

This will install all needed dependencies.

## Run

Then simply upload the theme and activate it.
